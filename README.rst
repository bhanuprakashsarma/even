SSH access granting service to distribute personal public SSH keys on demand.


Idea
====

Users can request temporary SSH access to servers by calling the "SSH Access Granting Service" which puts their public SSH key in place.

* The user needs to authenticate against the service (currently checked via LDAP bind)
* The user requests temporary SSH access for a certain host (``POST /access-requests``)
* The service checks whether the user is allowed to gain access to the specified host by checking if the host's IP is included in one of the IP networks configured on the user's LDAP roles (using the ``ipHostNumber`` LDAP attribute)
* The service instructs the host to grant access via a SSH forced command script
* The forced command script downloads the user's public SSH key from the service (the public SSH key is read from LDAP)
* The forced command script configures the ``/home/<user>/.ssh/authorized_keys`` file accordingly

Development
===========

The service is written in Clojure. You need Leiningen_ installed to build or develop.

To start a web server for the application, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ lein repl
    => (go)

The service is now exposing its HTTP REST API under http://localhost:8080/.

Requesting access to server "127.0.0.1" for user "jdoe":

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl -u jdoe -XPOST -H Content-Type:application/json --data '{"hostname": "127.0.0.1", "reason": "test"}' http://localhost:8080/access-requests

Building
========

To build a deployable artifact, use the ``uberjar`` task, that produces a single JAR file, that every JVM should be able to execute.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ lein do uberjar, docker build

Running
=======

Running the previously built Docker image and passing configuration via environment variables:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker run -p 8080:8080 -e AWS_REGION_ID=eu-west-1 -e LDAP_HOST=ldap.example.org -e LDAP_SSL=true -e LDAP_BASE_DN=ou=users,dc=example,dc=org -e LDAP_GROUP_BASE_DN=ou=groups,dc=example,dc=org -e LDAP_BIND_DN=uid=ssh-key-reader,ou=users,dc=example,dc=org -e LDAP_PASSWORD="$LDAP_PASSWORD" -e SSH_PRIVATE_KEY="$SSH_PRIVATE_KEY" stups/even

All configuration values can be passed encrypted when running on AWS (this is supported by the underlying Friboo_ library):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ aws kms encrypt --key-id 123 --plaintext "secret" # encrypt with KMS
    $ export LDAP_PASSWORD="aws:kms:<KMS-CIPHERTEXT-BLOB>"

Configuration
=============

The following configuration parameters can/should be passed via environment variables:

``AWS_REGION_ID``
    Optional AWS region ID to use for KMS decryption (e.g. "eu-west-1").
``HTTP_TOKENINFO_URL``
    URL to OAuth2 token info endpoint.
``LDAP_BASE_DN``
    DN of the user base.
``LDAP_BIND_DN``
    DN of the user to bind with.
``LDAP_CONNECT_TIMEOUT``
    LDAP connection timeout in milliseconds (default: 10s).
``LDAP_GROUP_BASE_DN``
    DN of the group base.
``LDAP_HOST``
    The LDAP server hostname to connect to.
``LDAP_PASSWORD``
    The user's bind password (can be encrypted with KMS).
``LDAP_SSL``
    Boolean flag (``true`` or ``false``) whether to use TLS for the LDAP connection.
``OAUTH2_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL``
    URL to OAuth2 provider endpoint to get a new service access token.
``SSH_AGENT_FORWARDING``
    Boolean flag whether to use agent forwarding (``-A``). Agent forwarding is necessary for bastion host support.
``SSH_PORT``
    SSH port number to use (default: 22).
``SSH_PRIVATE_KEY``
    The SSH private key (can be encrypted with KMS).
``SSH_USER``
    The SSH username on remote servers (default: "granting-service").
``USERSVC_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY_URL_TEMPLATE``
    URL template for the public SSH key endpoints ("{user}" will be replaced with the user's ID/username).

Requesting SSH Access
=====================

Users can use the convenience script Piu_ instead of doing a manual HTTP POST.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo pip3 install --upgrade stups-piu
    $ piu 172.31.0.1 "testing the piu script"
