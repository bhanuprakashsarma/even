This is work in progress.


Idea
====

Users can request temporary SSH access to servers by calling the "SSH Access Granting Service" which puts their public SSH key in place.

* The user needs to authenticate against the service (currently checked via LDAP bind)
* The user requests temporary SSH access for a certain host (``POST /access-requests``)
* The service checks whether the user is allowed to gain access to the specified host by checking if the host's IP is included in one of the IP networks configured on the user's LDAP roles (using the ``ipHostNumber`` LDAP attribute)
* The service instructs the host to grant access via a SSH forced command script
* The forced command script downloads the user's public SSH key from the service (the public SSH key is read from LDAP)
* The forced command script configures the ``/home/<user>/.ssh/authorized_keys`` file accordingly

Testing
=======

Testing the forced command script with a local mock service:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo touch /etc/ssh-access-granting-service.yaml
    $ sudo chown $USER /etc/ssh-access-granting-service.yaml
    $ echo 'ssh_access_granting_service_url: "http://localhost:9000"' > /etc/ssh-access-granting-service.yaml
    $ # serve your own public key via HTTP
    $ mkdir -p public-keys/testuser
    $ cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub public-keys/testuser/sshkey.pub
    $ python3 -m http.server 9000 &
    $ ./grant-ssh-access-forced-command.py grant-ssh-access testuser
    $ ssh testuser@localhost # try logging in

Development
===========

The service is written in Clojure. You need Leiningen_ installed to build or develop.

To start a web server for the application, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ lein repl
    => (go)

The service is now exposing its HTTP REST API under http://localhost:8080/.

Requesting access to server "127.0.0.1" for user "jdoe":

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl -u jdoe -XPOST -H Content-Type:application/json --data '{"hostname": "127.0.0.1", "reason": "test"}' http://localhost:8080/access-requests

Building
========

To build a deployable artifact, use the ``uberjar`` task, that produces a single JAR file, that every JVM should be able to execute.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ lein uberjar
    $ docker build -t ssh-access-granting-service .

Running
=======

Running the previously built Docker image and passing configuration via environment variables:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker run -p 8080:8080 -e AWS_REGION_ID=eu-west-1 -e LDAP_HOST=ldap.example.org -e LDAP_SSL=true -e LDAP_BASE_DN=ou=users,dc=example,dc=org -e LDAP_BIND_DN=uid=ssh-key-reader,ou=users,dc=example,dc=org -e LDAP_PASSWORD="$LDAP_PASSWORD" -e SSH_PRIVATE_KEY="$SSH_PRIVATE_KEY" ssh-access-granting-service

All configuration values can be passed encrypted when running on AWS:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ aws kms encrypt --key-id 123 --plaintext "secret" # encrypt with KMS
    $ export LDAP_PASSWORD="aws:kms:crypto:<KMS-CIPHERTEXT-BLOB>"

ToDos
=====

This is purely experimental, but at least the following would be needed:

* Integrate with Kerberos infrastructure
* Implement SSH key rotation
* Review security concept
* Harden everything
